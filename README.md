# Space Block Text Jumper

Navigational package for the VS Code text editor.

This package lets you jump with the cursor vertically across space/whitespace separated blocks/paragraphs and skipping empty lines. It also lets you select while jumping and has a command that selects current block/paragraph.

I made similar plugins for [atom](https://github.com/aronj/space-block-jumper) and [sublime text](https://github.com/aronj/sublime-space-block-jumper) before.
