# Space Block Text Jumper

Navigational package for the VS Code text editor.

This package lets you jump with the cursor vertically across space/whitespace separated blocks/paragraphs and skip empty lines. It also lets you select while jumping and has a command that selects current block/paragraph.

# Usage

Jumping inside a block takes you to the its edge. When jumping from an edge of a block the cursor skips the closest edge in the new block. Consecutive empty lines are always skipped.

# Examples

Moving between blocks and using selection
